# Power-System-Fault-Detection
This project uses IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI to build and deploy a machine learning model for detecting and classifying power system faults based on voltage and current phasor data. The solution automates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on IBM Cloud, enabling real-time fault detection via a REST API.
