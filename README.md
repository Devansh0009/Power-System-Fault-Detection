# Power-System-Fault-Detection
This project uses IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI to build and deploy a machine learning model for detecting and classifying power system faults based on voltage and current phasor data. The solution automates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on IBM Cloud, enabling real-time fault detection via a REST API.

1. Key Features
~Dataset: Uses power system measurement data (voltage and current phasors) with labeled fault types.

~Automated ML: Employs IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI for end-to-end model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.

~Fault Classification: Accurately distinguishes between multiple fault types—such as transformer failure, line breakage, and overheating—and normal conditions.

~Cloud Deployment: Trained models are deployed as REST API endpoints on IBM Watson Machine Learning Lite for real-time or batch predictions.

~Scalable & Reproducible: Entire process is managed on IBM Cloud, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and easy reproducibility.

2. Use Cases
~Automated power grid monitoring and fault detection.
